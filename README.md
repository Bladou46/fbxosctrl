This command line utility handles some FreeboxOS commands which are sent to a
freebox server to be executed within FreeboxOS app.

Free is a French DSL operator (free.fr) providing two set-top-box :
  * Freebox Server, connected to the ADSL wire
  * Freebox Player, connected to the TV

This tool applies to the server box of Freebox v6 (aka Freebox Revolution) only with latest firmware (v3.X).
FreeboxOS is the name given by Free.fr to their software running inside the Freebox Server.

The Frebbox Server address is discovered via mDNS and HTTPS is used to dialog with it.
